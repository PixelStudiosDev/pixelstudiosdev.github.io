# Working with Guilds API

- Once you have added `Guilds` as a dependency in your project, you can start using the Guilds API.


<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="new" label="v2.0" default>
        The new API is designed to be more user-friendly and efficient.
        The previous API was integrated into the jar file of the plugin, which was causing problems in some cases.

        The new API is now a separate dependency, which allows for better modularity and flexibility in your projects.

        It is based on the `GuildAPI` class, which has the **Provider** interfaces.

        As you can see, on the [Github repository](https://github.com/PixelStudiosDev/GuildsAPI/blob/master/src/main/java/me/leoo/guilds/api/objects/GuildAPI.java)
        of the GuildsAPI, the `GuildAPI` class is an interface that provides methods to interact with the guilds system.

        We have got the following interfaces:
        - `GuildProvider`: This interface provides methods to interact with the guilds system.
        - `PlayerProvider`: This interface provides methods to interact with the players in the guilds system.
        - `UtilsProvider`: This interface provides utility methods to interact with the guilds system.

        `GuildProvider` is the one that you will use the most, as it provides methods to interact with the guilds system.

        You can use methods such as `GuildAPI.getGuildProvider()` to get the `GuildProvider` instance (the same for the other interfaces).

        We recomment to create a static variable for each provider you use in your project, so you can access it easily.

        ```java title="Example.java"
       import me.leoo.guilds.api.objects.GuildAPI;
       import me.leoo.guilds.api.objects.guild.GuildProvider;

       public class Example {
           private static final GuildProvider GUILD_PROVIDER = GuildAPI.getGuildProvider();

           private static final PlayerProvider PLAYER_PROVIDER = GuildAPI.getPlayerProvider();

           private static final UtilsProvider UTILS_PROVIDER = GuildAPI.getUtilsProvider();
       }
        ```

        Once you have the provider instances, you can use them to interact with the guilds system.

        ## Examples

        Here, you will see some example for each provider.
        We will not explore many methods, you can do that by yourself in two ways:
        - Checking the [Github repository](https://github.com/PixelStudiosDev/GuildsAPI/tree/master/src/main/java/me/leoo/guilds/api) of the GuildsAPI, where you can find the source code of the API.
        - Checking the methods when writing your code, as the IDE will show you the methods available in the interfaces.

        We will may publish the Javadocs of the API in the future, but for now, you can use the source code to understand how to use the API.

        <Tabs>
            <TabItem value="guild" label="GuildProvider" default>
                The `GuildProvider` interface provides methods to interact with the guilds system.

                ### Example methods

                - `GuildView getByUuid(UUID uuid)`: Returns the guild with the given UUID.
                - `GuildView getByName(String name)`: Returns the guild with the given name.
                - `GuildView getByPlayer(Player player)`: Returns the guild of the player.
                - `GuildView getByPlayer(UUID player)`: Returns the guild of the player with the given UUID.

                - `List<GuildView> getGuilds()`: Returns a list of all guilds on the server.

                ### Example usage

                ```java title="ExampleGuild.java"
                    public GuildView getGuildByPlayer(UUID playerUuid) {
                        GuildView guild = GUILD_PROVIDER.getByPlayer(playerUuid);

                        if (guild == null) {
                            return null; // Player is not in a guild
                        }

                        return guild;
                    }

                    public GuildView getGuildByName(String name) {
                        GuildView guild = GUILD_PROVIDER.getByName(name);

                        if (guild == null) {
                            return null; // Guild does not exist
                        }

                        return guild;
                    }

                    public List<GuildView> getAllGuilds() {
                        return GUILD_PROVIDER.getGuilds();
                    }

                     // Get guilds with less than 10 members
                    public List<GuildView> getUnderfilledGuilds() {
                        return GUILD_PROVIDER.getGuilds().stream()
                            .filter(guild -> guild.getMembersView().size() < 10)
                            .collect(Collectors.toList());
                    }
                ```

            </TabItem>

            <TabItem value="player" label="PlayerProvider">
                The `PlayerProvider` interface only provides a few methods to interact with the players in the guilds system.

                ### Methods List

                - `PlayerView getPlayer(UUID uuid)`: Returns the player with the given UUID.
                - `PlayerView getPlayer(Player player)`: Returns the player with the given Player object.

                ### Why using PlayerProvider?

                It could be useful in some cases, but in most cases you will be able to use:
                `GuildView.getPlayer(UUID uuid) or GuildView.getPlayer(String name)` methods to get the player in the guild.
                Each of these methods returns a `PlayerView` object, which contains information about the player in the guild.

                ### Example usage

                ```java title="ExamplePlayer.java"
                    public PlayerView getPlayerByUuid(UUID uuid) {
                        return PLAYER_PROVIDER.getPlayer(uuid);
                    }

                    public PlayerView getPlayerByName(String name) {
                        return GUILD_VIEW.getPlayer(name); // Using GuildView to get the player
                    }
                ```
            </TabItem>

            <TabItem value="utils" label="UtilsProvider">
                The `UtilsProvider` interface provides utility methods to interact with the guilds system.

                ### Methods List

                - `void debug(String message)`: Sends a debug message to the console.

                :::info
                For debug method, you can use the `GuildAPI.debug(String message)` method instead, which is a static method that does the same thing.
                :::

                ### Example usage

                ```java title="ExampleUtils.java"
                    public void logDebugMessage(String message) {
                        UTILS_PROVIDER.debug(message);
                    }
                ```
            </TabItem>
        </Tabs>
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="old" label="v1.0">
        - The main class of the Guilds API is `GuildsAPI`. You can use this class to access the API methods.

        # GuildsAPI class methods

        ### Guilds

        - `getGuilds()`: Returns a list of all guilds on the server.
        - `getShownGuilds()`: Returns a list of all shown guilds.

        ### Getting a guild

        #### By guild's UUID
        - `getGuildByUuid(UUID uuid)`: Returns the guild with the given UUID. Returns `null` if the guild does not exist.

        #### By player's UUID
        - `getGuildByPlayer(UUID playerUuid)`: Returns the guild of the player with the given UUID. Returns `null` if the player is not in a guild.

        #### By guild's name
        - `getGuildByName(String name)`: Returns the guild with the given name. Returns `null` if the guild does not exist.

        # Example

        ```java title="ExampleListener.java"
        @EventHandler
        public void onJoin(PlayerJoinEvent event) {
            Player player = event.getPlayer();

            Guild guild = GuildsAPI.getGuildByPlayer(player.getUniqueId());
            if (guild == null) {
                return;
            }

            player.sendMessage("You are in the guild " + guild.getName() + "!");
        }
        ```
