        ## Customizing reward descriptions

        Reward descriptions displayed in menus can be customized to override the default description defined in `rewards.yml`:
        ```yaml showLineNumbers
        rewards:
          - type: points
            amount: 10
            # Override the default description
            # The {amount} placeholder is available
            description: "&8+ &7A nice gift!"
        ```

        ## The reward leveling system

        Using the points earned by completing achievements, players can unlock rewards. <br/>
        Below is an example configuration:

        :::tip
        You can use the `{level}` placeholder to get the current level. <br/>
        Math expressions and functions are supported!
        :::

        ```yaml title="rewards.yml" showLineNumbers
        # Default descriptions for rewards.
        # You can hide a description for a reward by deleting it.
        reward-descriptions:
          # <reward-id>: "<description>"
