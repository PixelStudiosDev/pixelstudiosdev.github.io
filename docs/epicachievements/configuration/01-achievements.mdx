        Below is an example of an achievement configuration:

        ```yaml title="achievements/survival/challenges.yml" showLineNumbers=true"
        # Unique identifier. Don't modify it or players will lose their progress!
        lucky-catch:
          # The type of task
          # See https://wiki.pixelstudios.dev/epicachievements/configuration/tasks

        ### Interactive setup

        The easiest way to create and edit achievements is by using the in-game editor. <br/>
        > You can access it by typing `/achievements editor`.

        ### Manually editing configurations

        If you're a more advanced user, you can manually edit the achievements' configurations.

        :::note
        Achievements are located in the `plugins/EpicAchievements/achievements/<category>` folder. <br/>
        You can have as many achievement files as you want in a category. <br/>
        By default, the in-game editor will create new achievements in a file named `achievements.yml` if none exists.
