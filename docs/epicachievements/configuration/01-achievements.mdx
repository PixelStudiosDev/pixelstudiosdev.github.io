        ### Interactive setup

        The easiest way to create and edit achievements is by using the in-game editor. <br/>
        > You can access it by typing `/achievements editor`.

        ### Manually editing configurations

        If you're a more advanced user, you can manually edit the achievements' configurations.

        :::note
        Achievements are located in the `plugins/EpicAchievements/achievements/<category>` folder. <br/>
        You can have as many achievement files as you want in a category. <br/>
        By default, the in-game editor will create new achievements in a file named `achievements.yml` if none exists.
        :::

        Below is an example of an achievement configuration:

        ```yaml title="achievements/survival/achievements.yml"
        # Unique identifier. Don't modify it or players will lose their progress!
        builder:
        # The type of task: See https://wiki.pixelstudios.dev/epicachievements/configuration/tasks
        type: PLACE
        # The name used in messages and menus
        name: "Builder"
        # The description of the achievement
        description:
        - "&fPlace blocks."
        # (Optional) Permission required to progress in the achievement
        permission: achievements.builder
        # Required achievements to progress in this achievement
        required-achievements:
        - miner
        - farmer

        tiers:
        1:
        # Progress required to complete the tier
        required-amount: 10
        # Points awarded when completing the tier
        points: 25
        # A list of rewards. See https://wiki.pixelstudios.dev/epicachievements/configuration/rewards
