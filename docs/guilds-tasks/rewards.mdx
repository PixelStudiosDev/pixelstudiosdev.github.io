## Structure

```yaml title="tasks.yml"
get_diamonds:
  type: block_break

  conditions:
    - type: block
      materials:
        - DIAMOND_ORE
        - GOLD_ORE

  rewards:
    - guild_xp:100
    - guild_quest:2
```

We are going to focus on the `rewards` part of the task structure. <br/>

`Rewards` is a list of rewards, written as a list of strings, **each element** follows the format: `{reward_type}:{value}` <br/>

where `{reward_type}` is the type of reward and `{value}` is the value for that reward. <br/>
Value is **usually** a number, but it can also be another type of value, depending on the reward type. <br/>

### General Conditions

These conditions will be structured using a string to value format. <br/>

| Type          | Values Type | Description                         | Example         |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|
