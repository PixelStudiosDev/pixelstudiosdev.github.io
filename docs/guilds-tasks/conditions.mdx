## Structure

```yaml title="tasks.yml"
get_diamonds:
  type: block_break

  conditions:
    - type: block
      materials:
        - DIAMOND_ORE
        - GOLD_ORE

  rewards:
    - guild_xp:100
```

We are going to focus on the `conditions` part of the task structure. <br/>

`Condtions` is a list of conditions written in this format:

```yaml
- type: <condition_type>
    <condition_parameters>
```

where `<condition_type>` is the type of condition and `<condition_parameters>` are the parameters for that
condition. <br/>

## Parameters

Before looking at the available condition types, let's look at the parameters formats that can be used in
conditions. <br/>

- String to value: `<parameter_name>:<value>` <br/>
Example: `min-food:10` <br/>

- String to list of values as YAML array. <br/>
Example:
```yaml
materials:
  - DIAMOND_ORE
  - GOLD_ORE
  ```

### How do parameters work effectively?

You will be able to find both formats depending on the condition type. <br/>

In the complete documentation you will be able to find:

- The accepted conditions for each task
- The parameter name of each condition
- The accepted values and formats for each parameter (

:::note
Keep in mind that **you can't** use a different format from the one specified in the documentation for that condition
type. <br/>
You can get into trouble if you try to use a different format, so please follow the documentation carefully. <br/>
:::

## Types

Condition types are string values which define the type of condition. <br/>

:::warning
The plugin actually supports ONLY the 1.8 achievements and tasks, so as of now, you can not use later achievements or
tasks. <br/>
We will implement features of newer versions in the future. <br/>

### General Conditions

These conditions will be structured using a list. <br/>
In the table below, you can find the type id, the path and allowed values for each condition.
