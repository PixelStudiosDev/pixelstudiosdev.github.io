# Frequently Asked Questions

Here you can find some frequently asked questions about the plugin.

### Are maps included with the purchase?

No, only the plugin is included.

### Does the plugin support arenas in custom worlds?

Wool Wars can't load arenas in unloaded worlds. If you want to create an arena in a non-vanilla world you must use a
world management plugin to load it (e.g. [Multiverse-Core](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-core)).
